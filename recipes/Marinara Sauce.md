# Marinara Sauce

### Ingredients
* 1-2 Tablespoons Olive oil
* 1/2 Onion, diced
* 6-8 Garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2-1 Tablespoons Red Pepper Flakes
* Dried Herbs (optional)
* 6 ounces of Tomato paste
* ~45 ounces of Diced tomatoes
* 1-3 Bay Leaves
* 2 Tablespoons Butter
* Parmigiano-Reggiano rind
* Kosher Salt
* Fresh herbs (optional)

### Directions

On medium-low to medium heat, heat the olive oil until shimmering, then add diced onion and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally.

Add garlic, cooking until garlic becomes fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.

Add tomato paste, red pepper flakes, and any other dried herbs, and cook, stirring frequently until color of paste darkens, 3-6 minutes.

Add diced tomatoes, bay leaves, butter, and Parmigiano-Reggiano rind, stirring until butter has fully melted. Simmer for 1 or more hours, depending on tomato acidity, tasting occasionally, adding salt when necessary.

Near end of cooking, add fresh herbs.

### Alterations

If you want a meatier sauce, make meatballs and cook in the sauce for the last 15-30 minutes, depending on size of meatballs and desired meatball rigidity.
