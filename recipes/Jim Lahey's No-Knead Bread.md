## Ingredients

- 3 cups All-Purpose Flour or Bread Flour, plus more for dusting
- ¼ teaspoon instant yeast
- 1¼ teaspoons Kosher or Sea Salt
- 1⅝ cups Warm Water (around 105-110°F)
- Cornmeal or wheat bran as needed

## Directions

### Making the dough

In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add water, mixing until blended into a shaggy, sticky dough. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at room temperature, about 70°F.

### Forming the dough

Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place the dough on it; sprinkle the dough with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for about 15 minutes.

Using just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran, or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it's ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

### Baking the bread

At least a half-hour before the dough is ready, heat the oven to 450-500°F. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex, or ceramic) in the oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove the pot from the oven. Slide your hand under the towel and turn dough over into the pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is okay. Shake the pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, the remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
