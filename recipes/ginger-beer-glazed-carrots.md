## Ingredients

- 1 lb Carrots, about 7 medium, peeled and cut ¼-inch on the bias
- 2 tablespoons Unsalted Butter
- Heavy pinch Kosher Salt
- 1 cup Ginger Beer
- ½ teaspoon Chili Powder
- 1 tablespoon Fresh Parsley, Chopped

## Directions

### Cooking the Carrots

Combine the carrots, butter, ginger beer, and salt in a 10 to 12-inch sauté pan over medium heat. Cover and bring up to a simmer.

Once simmering, remove the lid and stir, then reduce the heat to low and return the lid to the pan, cooking for another 5 minutes.

Remove the lid again, add the chili powder and increase to high heat.

### Reducing the Ginger Beer

Cook on high heat, stirring occasionally, until the ginger beer has reduced to a glaze, about 4 to 5 minutes.

### Finishing

Place the carrots into a serving dish, sprinkle with the parsley and serve immediately.
