title: "Instant Pot Greek Yogurt"
---

## Ingredients

- 1 gallon Whole Milk, not ultra-pasteurized
- 2 tablespoons Plain Unsweetened Greek Yogurt with active cultures

## Tools

- Metal Tablespoon
- Metal Whisk
- Glass measuring cup, like a Pyrex
- Instant Pot with Yogurt function
- Instant read thermometer

## Directions

### Sterilizing the Instant Pot

Add 2 cups of water to the Instant Pot along with utensils. Set to pressure cook for 5 minutes. Once the pressure cook cycle is complete, do a quick release and carefully remove utensils from the pot.

If some of your utensils are too large to fit, boil some water and thoroughly rinse the utensil with the boiling water.

### Preparing the Milk

On your instant pot, add milk and set saute function to less, stirring with the whisk slowly, but constantly, until milk reaches 180°f. Turn off the Instant Pot and cool the milk until it is 108-114°f.

### Adding the Starter

Add yogurt to the measuring cup, then take a few tablespoons of the warm milk and add to the yogurt, then whisk the yogurt with the milk until well mixed. Whisk the yogurt/milk mixture into the rest of the milk.

### Incubation

Activate the yogurt function on the Instant pot, setting it for 8-12 hours, depending on desired tangy-ness, my preference is 9 hours.

### The Whey to Greek-ness

Pour yogurt into a yogurt strainer until desired thickness, my preference is about 4 hours, you should end up with a bit over a half gallon of greek yogurt.

As an alternative to a yogurt strainer, a pasta strainer or a sieve can be lined with cheesecloth over a mixing bowl.
