## Ingredients

- ½ stick (4 tablespoons) butter
- ½ onion (about 1 cup), chopped
- 1 chopped green bell pepper
- 1/4 cup of chopped celery
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1½ cups of long grain rice, uncooked
- 2 teaspoons of Cajun or Creole seasoning (like Slap Ya Mama), or to taste
- Pinch of kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper
- 1 Bay Leaf
- 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley
- 2¾ cups of chicken stock or broth, or water

## Directions

Add butter to a medium saucepan and melt. Add the vegetables and saute on medium for about 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook and stir it over medium heat until it begins to lightly brown. Add the seasonings and liquid, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, then cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until cooked through and most of the water has been absorbed. Let rest for 5 minutes off of the heat. Fluff with a fork and serve immediately.
