## Ingredients

- 1 lb. Boneless Chicken Breast
- 32 oz. Chicken Broth
- 3 cups Water
- 1-2 tablespoons Olive oil
- ½ Onion, diced
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 14 ounces Diced Tomatoes
- 1 cup Carrots, diced
- ½ cup Peas
- 1-2 Bay Leaves
- 1 tablespoon dried Basil
- 1 tablespoon dried Oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried Thyme
- 1 teaspoon Cumin
- ½-1 teaspoon White Pepper
- 2 teaspoons Fish Sauce (Red Boat brand preferred)
- 1 teaspoon Sesame Oil
- 8 oz. Egg Noodles
- 2 tablespoons Butter
- Kosher Salt

## Directions

Add the olive oil and onion to your pressure cooker, cooking with the sauté function on low until onions are nearly translucent, then add garlic and cook until fragrant.

Add the chicken, diced tomatoes, vegetables, seasoning, broth, and water, seal the pressure cooker and use soup setting set for 30 minutes.

Shortly before the pressure cooker timer is done, cook the egg noodles in a separate pot.

When the pressure cooker timer is done, use the quick release to equalize the pressure and open the pressure cooker.

Remove bay leaves, remove and shred the chicken breast, then toss the shredded chicken with some salt and 1 tablespoon of the butter, and add back into the soup.

Add cooked noodles, stir remaining tablespoon of butter into the soup, and salt to taste.
