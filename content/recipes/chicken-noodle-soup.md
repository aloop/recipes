## Directions

Add the olive oil and onion to your pressure cooker, cooking with the sauté function on low until onions are nearly translucent, then add garlic and cook until fragrant.

Add everything else except the butter and salt, then seal the pressure cooker and use soup setting set for 30 minutes.

When the pressure cooker timer is done, use the quick release to equalize the pressure and open the pressure cooker.

Remove bay leaves, remove and shred the chicken breast, then toss the shredded chicken with some salt and 1 tablespoon of the butter, and add back into the soup.

Stir remaining tablespoon of butter into the soup, and salt to taste.
