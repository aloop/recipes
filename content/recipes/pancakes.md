## Ingredients

- 2 cups (10oz) All-Purpose Flour
- 3 tablespoons Sugar
- 4 teaspoons Baking Powder
- ½ teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt
- 2 Large Eggs
- ¼ cup Vegetable Oil (or other neutral-flavored oil)
- 1½ cups Milk
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract

## Directions

Whisk dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. In a second bowl, add eggs and oil and mix until well combined, then mix in milk and vanilla extract. Add egg mixture to dry mixture and gently mix until just combined (should still be somewhat lumpy). Let the batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking.

Heat your griddle or pan over medium-high heat, there is no need to grease the griddle/pan because there is enough fat in the batter. An additional benefit is that this will produce a more even browning on the surface of the pancake.

Watch pancakes closely while cooking, they should be ready to flip when the top is nice and bubbly.
