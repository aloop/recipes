## Ingredients

- 1½ cups All-Purpose Flour
- 3½ teaspoons Baking Powder
- 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt
- 1 tablespoon Sugar
- 1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract
- 3 tablespoons Butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil (or other neutral-flavored oil)
- 1¼ cups Milk
- 1 Egg

## Directions

Sift dry ingredients together into a mixing bowl, then add wet ingredients and mix until combined.

Heat your griddle or pan over medium-high heat, there is no need to grease the griddle/pan because there is enough fat in the batter. An additional benefit is that this will produce a more even browning on the surface of the pancake.

Watch pancakes closely while cooking, they should be ready to flip when the top is nice and bubbly.
