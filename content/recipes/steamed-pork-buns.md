This recipe makes about 20 pork buns.

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 560g All-Purpose Flour
- 11g Instant or Dry Active Yeast
- ½ teaspoon Salt
- 1 teaspoon Baking Powder
- 30g Sugar
- 30g Vegetable Oil (or other neutral-flavored oil)
- 320g Whole Milk

### Filling

- 400g ground or chopped pork, not too lean
- 20g Spring Onion, chopped
- ½ teaspoon Fresh Ginger, finely chopped
- ½ teaspoon White Pepper
- ½ teaspoon Kosher/Sea Salt
- 2 tablespoon Light Soy Sauce
- 1 teaspoon Dark Soy Sauce
- 1 tablespoon Oyster Sauce
- 2 tablespoon Sesame Oil
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- 1 tablespoon Corn Starch
- 80g water

## Directions

### Making the Dough

Combine dry ingredients into a bowl and add milk and oil, then begin mixing.

Once everything is well incorporated, begin to knead the dough for about 8 minutes.

Place in a bowl and cover for 1-2 hours, or until dough has roughly doubled in size.

### Making the Filling

Add everything except the water to a mixing bowl, mix together, then add water in 3-4 steps, making sure the pork mixture absorbs the water before adding more.

Use immediately or cover and refrigerate until ready.

For extra flavor, take ¼-⅓ of the pork (before mixing with other ingredients) and cook until browned. Then let the cooked pork cool before mixing with the other ingredients.

### Making the Buns

Divide the dough evenly into about 20 pieces (about 50g each), then take each piece and lightly roll into a circle, then roll the edges inward towards the center of the dough, without rolling the center of the dough, so that it retains some thickness.

Once you have a flattened edge and a thicker center, add about 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture to the center of the dough, then begin folding the dough (difficult to describe in words, many youtube videos demonstrate how to accomplish this).

Place the formed buns onto individual pieces of slightly oversized parchment paper, and let rest for about 30 minutes.

### Cooking the Buns

While the formed buns are resting, bring a pot of water large enough for your bamboo steamer up to a simmer.

When the water is simmering and the buns have rested, begin adding the buns to the steamer, being careful not to overcrowd each level.

Cook the buns for 12-15 minutes, then remove the pot from the heat and leave them covered in the steamer for another 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes are up, carefully remove them from the steamer and enjoy!
