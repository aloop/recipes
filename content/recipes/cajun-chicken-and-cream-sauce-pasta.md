## Directions

### Making the Brine

Whisk water and salt until dissolved, then add sugar and whisk until dissolved. Then add everything else, cover and refrigerate for 4+ hours, or overnight.

### Roasting the Peppers

Preheat oven to 400-450°F. While oven is heating, line an appropriately sized baking sheet with parchment paper and place halved peppers skin side up onto the baking sheet.

When the oven finishes preheating, place the baking sheet in the oven and cook until skins have started to char and wrinkle, about 20-30 minutes.

Remove Baking sheet from the oven and place peppers in a bowl or baking dish and cover for another 20-30 minutes until cool enough to handle. Remove the skin, and when the pasta has been sauced slice into desired sizes and add to pasta.

### Cooking the Chicken

Remove chicken from brine, rinsing chicken if desired, then pat dry, taking care that no peppercorns are lodged in the meat. Discard remaining brine.

Season chicken with desired amount of Cajun seasoning, then bake or grill at 450°F until internal temp registers 165°F.

When ready to add to pasta, cut into desired size and mix into pasta.

### Making the Cream Sauce

In a small saucepan heat milk with salt up to a boil, then remove from heat. Time boil with when it needs to be added to the roux to avoid scalding the milk.

In another saucepan melt butter over low heat, adding garlic and cooking until fragrant. Blend in the flour, cooking slowly, stirring with a whisk, until the butter and flour froth together for 2 minutes without coloring.

Remove the roux from the heat, and as soon as it stops bubbling, add the hot milk and beat vigorously and thoroughly with the whisk to blend the milk with the roux.

Set the saucepan back over moderately high heat and bring to a boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.

Then add ½ cup of cream, lemon juice, and cheese, adding salt, white pepper, and Cajun seasoning to taste. Add garlic salt if desired.

### Cooking the Pasta

Bring a pot of salted water to boil, add pasta and cook to desired doneness, then drain the pasta and return it to the pot.

### Finishing the Dish

Add sauce to pasta, thoroughly mixing to coat pasta with sauce, then add chicken and roasted peppers, again mixing to coat. Add freshly chopped parsley or other fresh herbs if desired.
