## Ingredients

- 2 Eggs
- 2 sticks Butter, softened
- 1 cup Vegetable Oil (or other neutral-flavored oil)
- 1 cup Sugar
- 1 cup Powdered Sugar
- 1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract
- 4 cups + 2 tablespoons All-Purpose Flour
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1 teaspoon Cream of Tartar (or 1.5 teaspoons Baking Powder)

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350Â°f

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the eggs, butter, oil, sugar, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth.

Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well, then optionally refrigerate for 1 hour to reduce spread when baking.

Using a scoop or spoon, make balls of dough and place on an ungreased cookie sheet, then press the dough balls until slightly flat with a flat-bottomed glass which has been greased and dipped into some sugar.

Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, until cookies are just starting to brown around the edges. Immediately remove cookies from cookie sheet and place on a wire rack to cool.
