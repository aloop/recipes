## Ingredients

- 4 oz chocolate chips
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 4 oz cream cheese (room temperature)
- ¼ cup powdered sugar (add a few more tablespoons if needed)
- ¾ teaspoons Vanilla
- ¼ teaspoon Salt

## Directions

Make the ganache by adding the chocolate and heavy cream to a microwave-safe bowl or measuring cup and microwaving in 10 second intervals (stirring after each interval) until melted and well mixed. The ganache should then cool for about 25 minutes.

After the ganache has cooled, use an electric mixer to combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until it is very smooth with no lumps.
Beat in the ganache on medium speed, making sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as needed, until the frosting begins to hold a peak and becomes a bit thicker, about 1 minute.
