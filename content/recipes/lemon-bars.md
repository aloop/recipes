## Ingredients

### Shortbread Crust

- 1 cup (230g; 2 sticks) Unsalted Butter, melted
- ½ cup (100g) Granulated Sugar
- 2 teaspoons Pure Vanilla Extract
- ½ teaspoon Kosher Salt
- 2 cups + 2 Tablespoons (265g) All-Purpose Flour

### Lemon Filling

- 2 cups (400g) Granulated Sugar
- 6 Tablespoons (48g) All-Purpose Flour
- 6 Large Eggs
- 1 cup (240ml) Lemon Juice (about 4 lemons)

## Directions

### Preparation

Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9" × 13" baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out. Set aside.

### Making the Crust

Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned.

### Making the Filling

Sift the sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Add the eggs and lemon juice and whisk until completely combined.

Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.

### Finally

Once cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
