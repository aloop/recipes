## Ingredients

- ¼ stick (2 tablespoons) Butter
- ½ Onion (about 1 cup), chopped
- 1 Green Bell Pepper, chopped
- ¼ cup Celery, chopped
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1½ cups Long Grain Rice, uncooked
- 2 teaspoons Cajun or Creole seasoning, or to taste
- Pinch Kosher Salt
- ¼ teaspoon of Black Pepper, fresh ground
- 1 Bay Leaf
- 1 tablespoon Fresh Parsley, chopped
- 2¾ cups Chicken Broth

## Directions

Add butter to a medium saucepan and melt.

Add the vegetables and saute on medium for about 5 minutes.

Add the rice and cook and stir it over medium heat until it begins to lightly brown.

Add the seasonings and broth, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, then cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until cooked through and most of the broth has been absorbed.

Let rest for 5 minutes off of the heat. Fluff with a fork and serve immediately.
