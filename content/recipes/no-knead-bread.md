## Ratios

- 100 parts flour
- 1.5 parts salt
- 1 part instant yeast
- 70 parts water

## Ingredients

- 450g All-Purpose Flour or Bread Flour, plus more for dusting
- 4.5g teaspoon Instant Yeast
- 7g teaspoons Kosher or Sea Salt
- 315g Warm Water (around 70째F)
- Cornmeal or Wheat Bran as needed

## Directions

### Making the Dough

In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add water, mixing until blended into a shaggy, sticky dough. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at room temperature, about 70째F.

For best flavor, after rising at room temperature move the dough to the fridge for 3-5 days.

### Forming the Dough

On a well-floured surface, fold the dough onto itself 1 or 2 times and coax the dough into a round loaf shape. Cover with a well-floured towel for another 2-4 hours.

Alternatively shape the dough and place in a metal bowl which has been lightly greased with olive oil and loosely cover with a towel or plastic wrap.

### Baking the Bread

At least 30 minutes before the dough is ready, heat the oven to 450째F. Put a 6- to 8-quart dutch oven in the oven as it heats.

When the dough has finished rising, quickly and carefully remove the dutch oven from the oven and put the dough in seam-side up, then place the lid back on the dutch oven and put it back into the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for another 25-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and a thermometer in the center of the bread reads 209째F.

When the bread is done, remove it from the dutch oven and place on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before cutting.
