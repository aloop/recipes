## Ingredients

- 1-2 tablespoons Olive oil
- Â½ Onion, diced
- 6-8 Garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon Red Pepper Flakes
- Dried Herbs (optional)
- 6 ounces of Tomato paste
- ~45 ounces of Diced tomatoes
- 1-3 Bay Leaves
- 2 tablespoons Butter
- Parmigiano-Reggiano rind
- Kosher Salt
- Fresh herbs (optional)

## Directions

On medium-low to medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering, then add diced onion and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally.

Add garlic, cooking until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.

Add tomato paste, red pepper flakes, and any dried herbs, cooking while stirring frequently until color of paste darkens, 3-6 minutes.

Add diced tomatoes, bay leaves, butter, and Parmigiano-Reggiano rind, stirring until butter has fully melted. Simmer for 1 or more hours, depending on tomato acidity. Taste occasionally, adding salt when necessary.

Near end of cooking, add fresh herbs.

## Alterations

If you want a meatier sauce, make meatballs and cook in the sauce for the last 15-30 minutes, depending on size of meatballs and desired meatball rigidity.
